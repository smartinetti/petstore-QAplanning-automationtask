PetStore Requirements

As a Owner of Pet Store
I want to sell pets to registered customers
So the system provides some operations to manage pets, users and orders in the store


Pet object is managed by PetStore server with the following actions:
- Add a new pet to the store with all relevants data: id, category, petName, photo, tags and status
- Update an existing pet in the store with all relevants data: id, category, petName, photo, tags and status
- Change name and status of the pet by pet id
- Upload an image file of an existing pet in the store by pet id
- Delete an existing pet in the store by pet id
- Filter pets by status (available, pending, sold)
- Filter pet by id


The actions available for the store management are:
- Get how many pets are in the store for each status
- Get the order purchased by id
- Delete an order purchased by id
- Place an order with all relevants data: orderId, petId, quantity, shipDate, status, complete


User object is managed by PetStore server with the following actions:
- Create a new user in the store with all relevants data: id, username, firstName, LastName, email, password, phone, userStatus
